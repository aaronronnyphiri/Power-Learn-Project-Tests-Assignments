        <p>
            A home is a place where a person feels protected from the tension of everyday life. In<br>
            My house, I always feel safe and secure and I always want to spend as much time as possible <br>
            there. I live in a very beautiful house. It is located deep in the large city of Lusaka<br>
            the capital city of Zambia.

        <h2>How My House Is Built</h2>
        <p>
            My house is built in quite a busy area. There's a bus stop just two blocks away <br>
            a secondary school and a University just within a kilometer radius. Despite being this busy,<br>
            the are is a quiet place. My house is a three roomed house with a big <a href="./Livngroom.html">livingroom</a>
            ,a <a href="./Kitchen.html">Kitchen</a> and<br> a beautiful <a href="./Bedroom.html">bedroom</a>. It 
            is self contained. It is a small house and I like it that way.
