        <h1>MY  FAMILY</h1>
        <p>
            Hi my name is Aaron, I go to Lusaka West School where I am in grade twelve. My sports are basketball and volleyball. I am the oldest<br>
            child in my family. I am 18 years old and am cheeky too like my little sister. At school I have only one friend and she has been my<br>
            best friend ever since I started school. I want to tell you about my family.<br>
            My family is awesome. I have a brother, a sister and my parents. In our family we do things that you canâ€™t afford.<br>

            <h3>About Dad</h3>
            My dad goes to work and brings the money to pay the bills. He is a fire-fighter in our local fire department.<br>
            Everyone in our area calls him their hero because his job involves a lot of life saving activities.<br>
            Sometimes he takes us out for dinner and volleyball Which is cool because its the only time we get to spend time with him.

            <h3>About Mom</h3>
            My mum is smart and she means a lot to me and my sister. She is the coolest mom ever.<br>
            She is a nurse at our local clinic which is about a kilometer away. 
            
            <h3>About My Brother</h3>
            I love my family but mostly my little brother Jack because he is very cute, cheeky, funny and jumpy.<br>
            He is 12 years old and in grade 7 at my school. He is very inteligent too, that's why we get along so well.
           
            <h3>About My Sister</h3>
            In our family we have a cheeky little girl and that is my sister Lizzy. She is very cheeky you will never imagine. My<br>
            sister goes to day care every Friday and every time we pick her up she talks all the time all the way home.<br><br>

            My family is my world because I love my family very much more than my friends.
